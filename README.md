"Questo Ã¨ un programma libero, e sempre libero deve rimanere - Carlo Zanatto"

Politicalfeedback is divided into client-server application with the aim of creating a communication infrastructure able to reward the merits of each proposal without prejudice. It is also proposed to create a direct feedback between citizens and those who are mandated by them to solve concrete problems. Do not have an administrator or a hierarchy inside if not the self-determined by the feedback received about a single proposal.
